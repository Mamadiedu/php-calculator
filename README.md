4.	Percentage (%)
## Installation & Setup
Requirements
1.	PHP (via XAMPP/WAMP or a web server)
2.	Web Browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
## Steps to Run
1.	Clone the repository:
```
git clone <repository_url>
```
2.	Move the project to your XAMPP/WAMP server directory (e.g., htdocs in XAMPP).
3.	Start Apache in XAMPP/WAMP.
4.	Open your browser and go to:
```
http://localhost/php_calculator/index.php
```
5.	Use the calculator to perform calculations.
## How It Works
1.	Users input numbers and select operations using buttons.
2.	The PHP script processes the input and returns results when the "=" button is clicked.
3.	The following operations are supported:
## Testing the Calculator
Input = Expected Output
1.	5 + 3= 8
2.	10 – 4= 6
3.	6 * 2= 12
4.	20 / 5= 4
5.	2^3= 8
6.	√16= 4
7.	log(100)= 2
8.	50% of 200= 100
